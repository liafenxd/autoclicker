# autoclicker
An autoclicker DLL that can inject to any version of minecraft.

# About
Since I'm getting more familiar with process injection I decided to make an injectable autoclicker that remotely injects into minecraft.<br />
This autoclicker works on **any** version of minecraft.

# Dependencies
 - [Process Hacker 2](https://processhacker.sourceforge.io/downloads.php) (or any process viewer of your choice) for injection

# Installation
To install this autoclicker, download the DLL file [here](https://github.com/the-antibody/autoclicker/releases/tag/1.0.0).<br />

### Injection
To inject the client, open [Process Hacker 2](https://processhacker.sourceforge.io/downloads.php) (or any process viewer of your choice), right click on your minecraft process (For Lunar Client, click on the top Lunar Client process), hover over the `Miscellaneous` tab, and find the `Inject DLL` option.<br />
Once clicked, open the DLL that you downloaded, and follow through on the prompt.

# autoclicker
An autoclicker DLL that can inject to any version of minecraft.

# About
Since I'm getting more familiar with process injection I decided to make an injectable autoclicker that remotely injects into minecraft.<br />
This autoclicker works on **any** version of minecraft.

# Dependencies
 - [A DLL Injection Client](https://github.com/the-antibody/dll-injector) (you can use any of your choice, but mine is linked there)

# Installation
To install this autoclicker, download the DLL file [here](https://github.com/the-antibody/autoclicker/releases/tag/1.0.1).<br />

### Injection
To inject the client, open your injection client (I will be using mine as the example), enter in the path to the DLL that you downloaded, and type in `Lunar Client` (or whatever minecraft client you're using), and then click `Inject`.
